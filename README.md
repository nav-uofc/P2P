/************************************
* CPSC471 - Group 19
* Project: P2P
************************************/

We are planning to add the following features:

  *   User Signup (limit to only ucalgary.ca domains, can be opened for other academic institutions)

  *   User Login

  *   Create Group

  *   Search for groups

  *   Request to join a group (if the group is open for new members)

  *   Approval system for request-to-join

  *   My groups (list of groups I control (Admin))

  *   My groups (list of groups I am a member of)


Good to have features:

  *   Profiling? based on your profile, we show you what we think you would be interested in?

  *   Site admin (banning certain users, etc...)

  *   Invite users to a group

  *   Ability to comment

  *   Tagging groups

  *   Rating other members

  *   Remove a member from a group
